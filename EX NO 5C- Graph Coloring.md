# EX 5C Graph coloring

## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
In a hilly region, several radio towers are installed to provide communication services. However, due to signal interference, two adjacent towers (i.e., in communication range of each other) must not use the same frequency channel.

## Algorithm
1. Input & Graph Construction:
Read number of towers n, available channels m, and connections e.
Build an adjacency list representing connections between towers (edges).
2. Color Representation:
Create a color[] array where color[i] stores the assigned channel for tower i.
Initially, all towers are uncolored (0).
3. Recursive Backtracking (isColorable):
For each tower (node), try assigning channels (colors) from 1 to m.
Before assigning, check if the channel is safe using the isSafe() function.
4. Safety Check (isSafe):
Ensure no adjacent (connected) tower has the same channel.
If safe, assign the channel and recursively color the next tower.
If no valid channel exists, backtrack by resetting the color. 
5. Result:
If all towers can be assigned valid channels → print "YES".
Otherwise → print "NO" (conflict in channel assignment).
